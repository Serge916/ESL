vep 1 ##
vep 1 ## memory and stack allocation for each partition
vep 1 ## - on each tile the system application takes the first 32 KiB
vep 1 ## - allocate 32KiB or 64KiB per partition, with a max of 128KiB per tile
vep 1 ##
vep 1 on tile 0 partition 1 has 16KiB stack in 32KiB memory starting at 32KiB
vep 1 on tile 0 partition 2 has 16KiB stack in 32KiB memory starting at 64KiB
vep 1 on tile 1 partition 1 has 16KiB stack in 64KiB memory starting at 64KiB
vep 1 on tile 2 partition 1 has 16KiB stack in 64KiB memory starting at 64KiB
vep 1 ##on tile 1 partition 3 has 0KiB stack in 32KiB memory starting at 96KiB
vep 1 ##
vep 1 ## shared memory allocation for this vep
vep 1 ## - the starting addresses are RELATIVE to the start of the shared memory
vep 1 ## - you can use decimal or hex, KiB=1024
vep 1 ## - size & address must use the same format (hex/dec)
vep 1 ## - use /opt/riscv/bin/riscv32-unknown-elf-size [-A] *.elf
vep 1 ##   in the partition directory to analyse its memory usage
vep 1 ## - use shared_memories/vep_shared_memories.h to manage shared memories
vep 1 ##
vep 1 ##on tile 0 partition 2 shares 64KiB private memory
vep 1 on tile 1 partition 1 shares 14KiB private memory
vep 1 on tile 2 partition 1 shares 14KiB private memory
vep 1 in shared memory memshared0 shares 92KiB private memory starting at 36KiB
vep 1 ##
vep 1 ## schedule for partitions that have a memory allocation
vep 1 ## - the slot table length must be the same for all slots on a processor
vep 1 ## - max 32 slots per tile
vep 1 ## - a partition can have more than one slot
vep 1 ## - slots are separated by VKERNEL slots of 2000 cycles
vep 1 ## - system partition uses cycles 0-4999; hence first user slot starts at 7000
vep 1 ##
vep 1 on tile 0 partition 1 has 58000 cycles of 127000 starting at  7000
vep 1 on tile 0 partition 2 has 58000 cycles of 127000 starting at  67000
vep 1 on tile 1 partition 1 has 58000 cycles of 67000 starting at  7000
vep 1 on tile 2 partition 1 has 58000 cycles of 67000 starting at  7000
